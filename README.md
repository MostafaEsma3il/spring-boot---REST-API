# spring-boot-REST-API

It is an educational project for me. 
In this project I was learning creating REST APIs/ web services with Spring.
I have also built a CRUD interface for the database with Spring REST.

Throughout this project I have dealt with a lot of things like, Spring boot, MySQL, Hibernate, Maven, XML and entity manager.

I knew about a lot of concepts like, Inversion of control, dependency injection "with its different approaches, different annotations, some database concepts and a lot more :)
